-- TODO: This query will return a table with two columns; customer_state, and 
-- Revenue. The first one will have the letters that identify the top 10 states 
-- with most revenue and the second one the total revenue of each.
-- HINT: All orders should have a delivered status and the actual delivery date 
-- should be not null.
